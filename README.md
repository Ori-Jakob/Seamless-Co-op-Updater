# Seamless-Co-op-Updater
A simple Python script for automatically updating Seamless Co-op mod for ELDEN RING

When the new update is downloaded and applied, the old configuration settings from the mod are tranfered to the new one at the cost of losing the commnets (limitations due to configparser Python lib)
